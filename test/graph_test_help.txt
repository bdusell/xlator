Graph test program
Commands:
    help                     - prints this summary of commands
    setVertex <key> <value>  - creates a vertex and assigns it a key; prints
                               graph contents
    getVertex <key>          - prints value of vertex associated with key
    setEdge <key1> <key2>    - sets the value of the edge connecting one vertex
                               to another; prints graph contents
    getEdge <key1> <key2>    - prints the value of the edge connecting one
                               vertex to another
    removeVertex <key>       - erases a vertex from a graph and all edges
                               associated with it; prints graph contents
    removeEdge <key1> <key2> - erases the edge connecting one vertex to another;
                               prints graph contents
    hasKey <key>             - tells if a key value is in use by the graph
    connected <key1> <key2>  - tells if two vertices are connected
    numVertices              - prints the number of vertices in the graph
    keys                     - prints all key values in use
    cyclic                   - tells if the current graph has a cycle
